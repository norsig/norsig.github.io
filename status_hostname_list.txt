# Structure:
# <COMMAND>;<HOSTNAME, IP or URL>;<PORT>
#
# COMMAND: Command to run. Can be ping, curl or nc.
#          ping = send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts
#          curl = transfer a URL
#          nc   = check TCP and UDP connections
#          grep = extension to the curl check
#                 curl downloads the webpage and pipes it to grep,
#                 that checks if the keyword is in the page.
#
